Evasion Escape is a fast-paced 2D avoidance game where players must dodge waves of enemies in increasingly challenging levels. 
With 50 levels to conquer and 9 unique characters to choose from, it offers both a thrilling and strategic experience for players of all skill levels.

Key Features:
50 Levels: Each level offers a unique set of challenges, requiring players to adapt and think quickly.
9 Playable Characters: Unlock different characters, each with unique abilities that can be vital in progressing through levels.
Challenging Mechanics: Designed to test your reflexes and strategic thinking.

Inspiration:
I created Evasion Escape as part of my Computer Science NEA. The game's mechanics were inspired by simple yet addictive games such as Agar.io, where survival and quick reflexes are key to success.
In addition, my Physics lessons played a crucial role in the design of the game. I wanted to incorporate basic physics principles into the gameplay, making it more engaging.
The use of physics mechanics adds an extra layer of challenge and strategy, as players must consider and predict how certain enemies may move and find a path around them.
